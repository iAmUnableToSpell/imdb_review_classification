This repository contains code used for CSDS234's term project

Implemented in /comparative_analysis.ipynb are several sentiment analysis algorithms, designed to read and compare movie reviews. 
A single keras embedding model is the focus of the project, while several scikit-learn auxillary models provide points for comparison. 

Please note that running the scikit-learn preprocessing step will download several corpi of training data along with a complete lexicon. 

Also note that running the second cell in /comparative_analysis.ipynb will download over a hundred thousand .txt files and save them in /datasets. 
See the cell for more information.
